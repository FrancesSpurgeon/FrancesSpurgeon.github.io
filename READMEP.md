# What is QR code?

You can think of a QR code as a string of text that only the machine can read. The more strings of text, the denser the QR code.

# Does the QR code produced have a time limit?

The QR code we created will not be stored on the server. There is no time limit and users can use it with confidence.

The most important point, please be sure to make legal content!

# Is there a limit on the number of scans made for the QR code?

Our QR code, text code, business card code, URL code, batch code, etc., are not limited by the number of scans.

# Will the created QR code and the scanned QR code be stored on the server? Will our privacy be revealed?

We will never store any QR code, no matter the code and scan code and the records generated, it will be local data, and will not get any private data of the user.

# Does this app have ads? In what way is it profitable?

This app has no profit, and it is not going to pick up the evil advertisements at present. It is an easy-to-use app made by the author's hobby!
